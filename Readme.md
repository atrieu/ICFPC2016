Dao of the fold

Got abandoned at the last moment by my teammates, so ended up doing the contest by myself.
Lost all motivation so only made a stupid solution that tries to place a blank sheet of paper without any folding on the first day, and have not tried to do anything better afterwards because I couldn't be bothered.
